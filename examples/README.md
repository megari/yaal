YAAL example projects
=====================

Here are some code samples.
All directories are prefixed with difficulty level, so you should start with examples starting with `basic_`.

To build examples you need [yaamake](https://github.com/raphendyr/yaamake).
You can install it as told on yaamake page or you can clone the repo and define `YAAMAKE` environment variable.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raphendyr/yaamake.git $HOME/yaamake
export YAAMAKE=$HOME/yaamake
```

This applies also to `build_test.sh` which is used to validate that all of the examples build without errors.
