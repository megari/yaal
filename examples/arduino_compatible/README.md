# Arduino compatible code example

This example in `main.cpp` shows how similar code compared to arduino we can create.

You shouldn't ever write this kind of code with YAAL, but you can easily port arduino code to yaal, just by changing pin variable defines.

Compare yaal code in `main.cpp` to same arduino code in `arduino.ino`.
